# Swim-Class-Registration-Application
Created a program which takes in user input such as a participants name, age and swimming experience. From there, a swim class is recommended for them to register. User can register for another swimmer once they register one person. Once registration is successful, swimmer information (ie. name and signed up class) are put into a database. Project made in Python using Turtle graphs and Tkinter GUI framework.

Things I want to add in the future:
1. An email confirmation system --> send a confirmation email with the swimmer's name and the class they registered for
2. SMS? --> similar to email confirmation but with a phone number

STUFF ABOVE IS IMPLEMENTED !
